# 🧠 Employee Salary Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts employee salaries based on features such as gender, education level, experience, and job title using supervised machine learning techniques. It uses Label Encoding for preprocessing and trains a `RandomForestRegressor` model for prediction.

## 📊 Problem Statement
Build an ML model that takes employee information (gender, education, job title, experience) and predicts their expected salary. This can be used in HR analytics or recruitment platforms.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Joblib (for saving model and encoders)
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

---

## 📌 Features
- Clean and preprocess raw HR data
- Label Encoding for categorical variables
- Train a salary prediction model (Random Forest)
- Save & load model using Joblib
- Accept inputs and output salary predictions
